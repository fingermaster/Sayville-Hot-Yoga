<p>Danielle Gagnon B.S. ED. and PSY, M. Art Therapy, Registered Art Therapist, C-YRKT
Danielle has been on a yoga journey for a while but, it really has made a significant impact on her over the past several years.  Sayville Hot Yoga has been her place of inspiration.
Danielle has worked in the Sachem School District for eleven years.  A love for children and children’s self-growth has always been part of her being.  Having a Dual Bachelor’s Degree in Education and Psychology and a Master’s in Art Therapy she has always been working on programs in the school to promote positive self-esteem and positive relationships.  She has used her art background to run various arts based / writing programs in her school.  These programs include; working with her entire school graphically, educating staff about the importance of art in the classroom, working with children whose families are facing divorce and most importantly working with art to enhance learning in her classroom, daily.  </p>

<p>Children are required to fulfill very specific tasks in school and this can cause heavy stressors on children of all ages.  Throughout her yoga journey Danielle has realized that yoga can have a very similar impact on children as art does.  Upon research, Danielle gratefully found the Yoga Rocks Program and became a C-YRKT (Certified Yoga Rocks Kids Teacher) in May of 2013.  She now uses stretching and breathing in her own classroom to increase stamina and promote healthy living.  Danielle believes that yoga can help children deal with their emotions and help children to become strong, centered individuals.  Over the past two years Danielle has taken a journey through yoga that is unexplainable and would like to foster children to experience this journey in a safe, creative, fun environment. </p>

<p>Danielle was also lucky enough to be trained by the SHY staff to teach the Beginner’s Hot Yoga class and the Vinyasa class.  Danielle focuses much on breath in her classes.  Her intention is to enable students to connect with the breath to open the heart, mind and body to all possibilities.  Danielle is thrilled to be sharing yoga with the community and to assist others in their journey.</p>

<p>Danielle offers children’s and teen yoga, Mommy (or Daddy) and Me, Kids Yoga Birthday Parties and Girl Scout Troup Yoga.  She also offers kids private parties and private lessons.</p>

<p>Danielle is currently enrolled in her 200 hour Yoga Alliance Ashtanga Teacher Training at Yoga Yama.
