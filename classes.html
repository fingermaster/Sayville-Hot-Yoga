			<a name="beginner-hot-yoga"></a>
			<h5>HOT YOGA</h5>
			<p>This is our beginner Hot Yoga class, perfect for all levels and taught in a moist, heated room, which helps loosen tight muscles and promotes sweating to help detoxify the body. Foundational breathing techniques and alignment principles are taught, slowly and compassionately, with detailed instruction. Variations are offered to accomodate students that might find something too difficult, as well as to more advanced students that want more of a challenge. This class is transformational, will create radiant health, and build flexibility and strength for your body mind and spirit.</p>

			<a name="hot-vinyasa"></a>
			<h5>HOT VINYASA</h5>
			<p>Vinyasa classes move at a more energetic pace where students will learn to flow  from one posture into the next in conjunction with the breath. Sun salutations along with a variety of postures and sequences, wraps/bindes, and inversions are taught. Ideal for advanced beginners ready for more of a challenge.

			<h5>HOOP DANCE</h5>
				<p class="bold"> Every Friday Night at 8pm with Mamma Jo</p>
				<p> Hooping is a fun and beautiful way to move your body. It is also great 
				exercise because you use all your muscles from top to bottom. It makes 
				you feel good about yourself and it's a great way to express yourself 
				creatively. The beginner Hoop Dance class will give beginners all the 
				tools and techniques that they'll need to get started on the hoop path. 
				Students will first learn a series of basic moves and techniques taught 
				for keeping the hoop up, recovery methods, dancing in your hoop and 
				other simple methods for moving in and out of the hoop. Then move on 
				to learning ways to spin the hoop in both a horizontal and vertical 
				plane and then the fun begins! Burn calories while having fun, great 
				for your posture, releases stress and very good for your digestive system 
				and waistline!! So let your inner child out to play! All are welcome! 
				Hoop Dance is included in your SHY membership... or is $12 to Drop In!
